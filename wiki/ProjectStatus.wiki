I am currently working on MobileChess and should have an alpha release soon. I am looking for ObjC coders with UIKit experience though since I am new to this language.

gnuchess builds and runs fine on the iPhone and seems to run fast enough to play a reasonable blitz game. Things get pretty slow with depth set to anything over 6 though and the hashsize has to be relatively small to fit in to available memory.
